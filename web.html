            <P> The term “fine jewelry” is used for any jewelry that is made from precious metals such as gold, silver, or platinum. Fine jewelry typically uses genuine gemstones like diamonds, sapphires, rubies, or emerald. Fine jewelry is durable and made to last. As a result, fine jewelry can be worn every day.
                Jewelry can also be given simply as a gesture of appreciation or thanks. Another value often placed on jewelry is its ability to protect its wearer from harm. Many believe certain stones and metals have magical properties to ward off evil spirits or bring good luck.
                Objects designed for the adornment of the body are called jewelry. While modern jewelry is made of gold, silver, or platinum, often with precious or semiprecious stones, it evolved from shells, animal teeth, and other items used as body decoration in prehistoric times.

            <p>.A necklace is jewelry you wear around your neck. You might decide your sparkly faux-diamond necklace is a bit dressy for your cousin's baseball game — but perfect for a fancy dinner out. A necklace can be a simple gold or silver chain, a length of beads or gems, or a pendant hanging from a cord.
                grasping it carefully, positioning the clasp, placing the necklace around the neck, and fastening the clasp securely

            <p>A ring is a round band, usually made of metal, worn as ornamental jewelry. The term "ring" by itself denotes jewellery worn on the finger; when worn as an ornament elsewhere, the body part is specified within the term, e.g., earrings, neck rings, arm rings, and toe rings.
                ring, circular band of gold, silver, or some other precious or decorative material that is worn on the finger. Rings are worn not only on the fingers but also on toes, the ears (see earring), and through the nose.

            <p>Bangles are circular in shape, and, unlike other bracelets, are not flexible. The word is derived from Hindi bungri (glass). They are made of numerous precious as well as non-precious materials such as gold, silver, platinum, glass, wood, ferrous metals, plastic, etc.
                A bangle is generally made out of some hard material like gold, silver, wood, plastic, or ivory. In most parts of South Asia, bangles are very commonly worn by women — there are special bangles that a bride, for example, traditionally wears at her wedding.
